# Parsify

Parsify is a command-line utility that allows you to use a specialized language to define parsing syntax and automatically generate ready-to-use C++ code to parse that syntax.

Parsify is primarily a personal project and is therefore tailored to my own use cases and may not be as general purpose as it could be. I don't currently have plans to extend Parsify's capabilities to be more general than I need them to be, but if you want to try yourself, be my guest; make a fork and knock yourself out.

## Features

* Automatically generate tokenization code based on a list of names and regular expressions defining them.

## Planned Features

* Automatically generate parsing code based on user-defined rules.
* Allow users to compile their tokenizer/parser combo directly to a DLL or executable.

## How to Use

As of right now, the code isn't ready for use.
